# Bettami Figma Conversion Xuaib

This is a Figma to HTML/Tailwind CSS conversion gig I got. Design is available [here](https://www.figma.com/design/PRwypfiFUh8gHWbPHL2u96/Bettami). I believe "Practice makes Perfect", so keep building I must.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library**  
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework**  
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript**  
- Nodejs (with/without Expressjs)
- MongoDB** 

### What I learned

- **Bookmarks VS Code Extension:**  
Use the Bookmarks VS Code extension by Alessandro Fragnani to easily navigate between very lengthy tabs.
- **Tailwind CSS Mobile Targeting:**  
Build with a mobile-first breakpoint mindset.  
Use un-prefixed utilities to target mobile and override them at larger breakpoints.  
- **Group and Group-Hover Classes in Tailwind CSS:**  
Utilize group and group-hover classes to style child elements based on the hover state of a parent element.
These can be used alongside breakpoints and the hidden class to control element visibility based on window size, without needing JavaScript.
- **Absolute and Relative Positioning Refresher:**  
Refreshed my knowledge of absolute and relative positioning to enhance layout control.
- **Figma AI for Property Confirmation:**  
Use Figma AI to confirm properties, but do the logic yourself.
- **Vanilla CSS Scrolling:**  
Implement horizontal/Vertical scrolling with vanilla CSS/Tailwind to make cards scroll one view per horizontal scroll.
- **Tailwind Installation via CLI:**  
Install Tailwind using the CLI for a better experience than the non-production possible Play CDN installation type.
- **Custom Fonts in Tailwind:**  
Add custom downloaded fonts to Tailwind for enhanced typography control.
- **Cropping PNGs:**  
Use [https://onlinepngtools.com/crop-png](https://onlinepngtools.com/crop-png) to crop .png images without distorting the background color.
- **Awesome Screen Recorder & Screenshot:**  
Utilize the Awesome Screen Recorder & Screenshot tool for recording project reviews.
